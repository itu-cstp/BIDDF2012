- Added missing primary key constraints on tables

- Added missing relation between positions a roles (positionRoles)

- Added language and hasLanguage relations (we didn't previously store the language)

- Removed releases relation and added it as an attribute on the productions relation (the IMDB data set contained only 1 release per production)

- Added country and hasCountry relations (we previously stored the country in the releases relation, but we removed it as explained above)

- Removed prodTypes relation, because the IMDB data set did not contain the information to use it

- Added ratings table of user ratings. This table contains no primary key constraints, as the data we are given contains no candidate key.
